    "1. A paragraph describing what you have done since HW 5.1\n",
    "Since completing HW 5.1, we've introduced an iteration of the MancalaAI class. What we have done is code out the minimax function and another variation of it which includes alpha_beta pruning. We used the code template provided by the TA. We’ve started work on incorporating deep copy so we can pass moves into the mancala game. We’ve also created a function to generate the possible moves for the AI. We’ve finished minimax and alpha beta pruning, but not sure if they are working correctly since we are getting some errors when the AI plays its turn.\n",
    "2. A list of what is not working\n",
    "We need to fully incorporate deep copy so we can pass moves into the mancala game, we need to finish the deep copy so that we can test out our minimax() and the alpha beta pruning(), match_analysis()\n",
    "3. A list of what is working\n",
    "Functions that work: we believe our functions work. We just need to finish the implementation of deepcopy so we can test it.\n",
    "4. A paragraph describing what you have left to do\n",
    "We're working on improving our MancalaAI class with three main features. First, we're adding a deep copy method to better handle instances of the class. Second, we're integrating the minimax_alpha_beta algorithm to make the AI's decision-making more efficient. Lastly, we're developing the match_analysis() function to provide a thorough evaluation of game outcomes and strategies. These enhancements are designed to make the MancalaAI class more capable, leading to smarter decision-making and strategic analysis during Mancala gameplay.\n"
